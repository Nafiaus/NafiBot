# NafiBot
This is a bot I'm creating for my twitch chat in C#. I'll be updating this as I add more to it.

---------------------------------------------------

FUTURE IDEAS

I want to add a logging method, so I can add a message history function so people can grab how many messages they have sent, or have a leaderboard.
